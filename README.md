- Input task and press **ENTER** or click *ADD* button to create your to-do.

- To-do must have value, not blank space.

- You can delete your to-do list after that if you want by clicking the *X* button.

#### Chat Room
- Like normal chat apps. This is where you can create chat room and send messages.

- Input chat room name and click *CREATE* button to create your chat room.

- Chat room name must be valid like to-do.

- You can add members to your chat room by email.

- Then just simply send your messages to your groups.

- You can see the username and email that you're using to access our website in Profile.

- Your information are absolutely confidential. Even our team cannot know it.

- Your account may be deleted due to toxic behaviors.

- You'll have to verify your email so make sure you're using a real and accessible email.

#### Class
- You can create class very easily with class name and password.

- To enter a class, you must type a class name and password. If that class is already existed, you'll be in that class. You just need to enter a specific class only once.

- This is where you can upload your files and get download URLs.

- You can use this for working, studying or even playing.

- We're working to develop the functionality of class.
---
#### Discussion
- This is where you post a discussion for everyone to discuss it through comment section (click the description and/or title to see the comments), like a forum.

- You can search post through title, description, author name or time.

- Discussions with bad content may be deleted by our team.

- Everyone who is authenticated can see discussions.

- We'll soon have admin team to check discussions and users.
---
#### Room
- This functionality is still in experiments.

- This works quite similar to Zoom.
  
- We have only implemented the basic functionality of a video call.
  
- We are working as hard as possible to implement more functionality.
  
- You have to create a room first and the room name must be unique.

- The room you created will be deleted after you press *LEAVE*.

- You should press *LEAVE* after you create and use the room because it's not reusable.

- Every room will last for 24 hours.
  
- Send your token and room name for others and join the meeting.
---
#### Learning Log
- This is where you keep track of your learning.

- Create your topics and everytime you learn something new, add a new entry to the suitable topic.

- Click the topic to see your entries.

- You can now delete the topic and its entries.
---
#### Playground
- This is where you have fun after stressful hours of studying.

- Click on a card and have fun.

- Maybe you will find some interesting facts about yourself or just an interesting game.

- Some of the games might need to be downloaded.

- Click on the link to download the game. Install it, open the folder that contains it then click on the .exe file.
