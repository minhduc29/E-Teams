#### Class
- You can create class very easily with class name and password. Class name must be unique.

- To enter a class, you must type a class name and password. If that class is already existed, you'll be in that class. You just need to enter a specific class only once.

- Only the members of a class can see that class.

- This is where you can upload your files and get download URLs, pretty similar to Google Classroom.

- You can use this for working, studying or even playing.

- We're working to develop the functionality of messaging in class.

#### Discussion
- This is where you post a discussion for everyone to discuss it through comment section (click the description and/or title to see the comments), like a forum.

- Discussions with bad content may be deleted by our team.

- Everyone who is authenticated can see discussions.

- We'll soon have admin team to check discussions and users.

#### Room
- This functionality is currently in experiments.

- This works quite similar to Zoom.

- We're working as hard as possible to fully integrate Agora into our website, you still can use this beta version with some limits.

#### Learning Log
- This is where you keep track of your learning.

- Create your topics and everytime you learn something new, add a new entry to the suitable topic. Only you can see your topics and entries.

- Click the topic name and/or Entry to see your entries.

- You can now delete the topic and its entries.
